# Test workshop

This is a unit testing assignment. The goal is to write tests for different edge cases of the function from task.ts file and score points.

## Points

Points are awarded for finding an edge case and writing a test for it.
The more critical the edge case, the more points you get.

* 1 point is awarded for simple edge cases where function does not behave as expected, but it is not critical.
* 2 points are awarded for edge cases where function can throw an error or critically misbehave.

## Setup

Be sure to use node version 20.17.0 or higher.

```bash
npm install
```

## Run tests

```bash 
npm test
```
